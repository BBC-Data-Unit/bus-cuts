More than a million people now live at least a mile from a bus stop with a regular service (calling on average four times a day).

Meanwhile the number of people using concessionary bus passes for older and disabled people has fallen by almost a fifth in a decade and government support for buses is down about £800m a year in real terms.

The government is putting £5bn over five years towards buses and cycling in England.

BBC Panorama [looked at the situation facing Britain’s bus services in a programme on 16 March 2020](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000ggpr). The data unit contributed to the programme and [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-51815726) on the story for BBC Online.
